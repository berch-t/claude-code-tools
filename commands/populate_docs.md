I need to create comprehensive documentation for: $ARGUMENTS

I'll analyze our current conversation history to extract the actual work we accomplished together and create a new .md file in the ai_docs folder based on our real implementation and discoveries.

**Step 1: Analyzing our conversation history**

I'll review our conversation to extract:
- The actual code we wrote and refined together
- The specific problems we encountered and solved
- The techniques and solutions we discovered
- The iterative improvements we made
- The final working implementation

**Step 2: Reading existing ai_docs formatting patterns**

Let me first examine the existing documentation files in ~/.claude/ai_docs/ to ensure I follow the exact same:
- Header structure and hierarchy
- Code example formatting
- Section organization patterns
- Use of `$ARGUMENTS` placeholders for dynamic content
- TypeScript interface patterns
- Best practices sections
- Troubleshooting sections
- Resources sections

**Step 3: Creating documentation from our actual work**

I'll create a new .md file documenting what we actually built, including:
- **Our exact implementation** - the final working code we created together
- **Problem-solving journey** - the specific issues we encountered and how we solved them  
- **Discovered techniques** - the methods we found effective (like S-curve mathematics, edge elimination)
- **Code evolution** - showing the progression from initial attempt to final solution
- **Lessons learned** - insights gained during our collaborative development process
- **Tested solutions** - only including approaches we actually verified work

**Step 4: Structuring with proven patterns**

The documentation will follow the ai_docs format but contain our real work:
- **Introduction**: Based on what we actually accomplished
- **Implementation**: Our exact working code with TypeScript patterns  
- **Techniques**: The specific methods we discovered and refined
- **Troubleshooting**: The actual problems we faced and our solutions
- **Best Practices**: Insights from our iterative development process
- **Usage Examples**: Real patterns from our working implementation
- **Code Snippets**: Using `$ARGUMENTS` for the techniques we developed

The documentation will capture our collaborative development process and serve as a reference for recreating and iterating on what we built together.

The new file will be saved as `~/.claude/ai_docs/[topic-from-our-conversation].md` containing our actual discoveries and working solutions.
